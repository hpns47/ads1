# Assignment 1 â€“ ADS (Algorithms & Data Structures)

This project contains 10 Java tasks focused on basic recursion, math logic, and array processing.  
Each task is implemented as a separate class with a `run()` method and includes simple time complexity notes.

## Tasks Overview

| Task | Description                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Find minimum element in array              |
| 2    | Calculate average of numbers               |
| 3    | Check if a number is prime                 |
| 4    | Calculate factorial using recursion        |
| 5    | Find nth Fibonacci number (recursive)      |
| 6    | Raise number to a power                    |
| 7    | Print numbers in reverse using recursion   |
| 8    | Check if string contains only digits       |
| 9    | Calculate binomial coefficient (C(n, k))   |
| 10   | Find GCD using Euclidean algorithm         |

## ow to Run

1. Open project in IntelliJ or any Java IDE.
2. Run `Main.java` to select a task.
3. Each task is interactive via console input.

## Time Complexity

Each task includes a short time complexity explanation as a comment in the code.

## Requirements Covered

- recursion practice
- simple math algorithms
- console input/output
- time complexity for each function
- clean code and basic comments
